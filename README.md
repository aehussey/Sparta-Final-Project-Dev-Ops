<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![image](screenshotawsarch.png)

Engineering 29/32 were tasked to build a distributed, highly reliable and fault tolerant architecture to provision a NodeJS/MongoDB Application. A high failover was required for the database driven application.

The solution was to develop an architecture using the AWS cloud platform automated with Terraform. The automation aspect allowed the team to build and test the underlying deployment code which increased its robustness. The engineering team proposed the following three elements to meet the architectural requirements.

* AWS ELK (Elastic Search, Logstash and Kibana)
* Multi Availability Zones
* MongoDB Replica Set

A list of commonly used resources that the team found helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.:smile:
